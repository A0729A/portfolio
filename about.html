      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
      Hello! My name is Fred Matsunami, and I'm a passionate web developer based in California. I specialize in building clean, user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy solving problems through code and continuously learning new technologies like React and Node.js. My goal is to develop projects that make a meaningful impact and contribute to the tech community. In my free time, I explore UI/UX design, contribute to open source, and collaborate with other developers on GitHub. I am currently seeking opportunities to grow as a developer and work on exciting, real-world applications.
